# BlackHole
A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing, including particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape from inside it.

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
